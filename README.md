# Robust LAD-LRT ENF Detetector

This repo contains the codes of the proposed Robust Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) ENF detector. We would like to acknowledge (Han et al.) for their work [Detection of Electric Network Frequency in Audio Recordingsâ€“From Theory to Practical Detectors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143185) which inspired us to develop our robust detector. We would like to thank them for sharing their codes in [ENF_Detection](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF_Detection) folder. 

# Dataset

For the evaluation of our method we used the H0 and H1 folders of the [ENF-WHU-Dataset](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF-WHU-Dataset).
