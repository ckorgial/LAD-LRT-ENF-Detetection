# Robust LAD-LRT ENF Detetection

We would like to acknowledge (Han et al.) for their work [Detection of Electric Network Frequency in Audio Recordingsâ€“From Theory to Practical Detectors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9143185) which inspired us to develop our robust detector. We would like to thank them for sharing their codes in [ENF_Detection](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF_Detection) folder. 

# Our Paper

This repo contains the codes of the proposed Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) ENF detector described in the **Electric Network Frequency Detection Unsing Least Absolute Deviations** paper. The paper was submitted to the ***2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing*** (ICASSP 2023).

# Dataset

For the evaluation of our method we used the H0 and H1 folders of the [ENF-WHU-Dataset](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF-WHU-Dataset).

# MATLAB Codes

1. **Calculate_Accuracy.m**
2. **Calculate_ROC_AUC.m**
3. **Test_Periodograms.m** 

# Authors

Feel free to send us a message for any issue.
